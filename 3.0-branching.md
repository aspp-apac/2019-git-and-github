# 3.0 Branching

Covered commands + concepts:
* `git branch`
* `git checkout`

Branching is a way for us to work on different features in an isolated environment.

As we've talked about in this lesson, commits are repository snapshots.

A branch is a pointer to a commit (the most recent commit in the branch history).

We can have multiple branches.

And we know which branch we're in with HEAD.

We can switch branches.

And we can commit in a branch, which will update both the branch and the HEAD pointer.

We can commit again.

And then we can switch branches.
