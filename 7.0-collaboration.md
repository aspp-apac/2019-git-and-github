# 7.0 Collaboration

* forking
* pull requests
* issues
* comparing changes
* `git fetch` and `git merge` with multiple remotes
* tagging issues in PRs

Often we will have changes on our remote that aren't on our local machine yet. There are a few ways we can get these changes pulled into our local machine effectively. First, `git fetch` will copy the remote changes into our git folder. `git fetch` on its own will copy all of the remote branches and stores them as remote tracking branches. We can see them with `git branch -a`. As an example, I'm going to fetch a repository I haven't updated in a few days. I have my fork, `origin`, and I have the upstream package that I forked that I named `upstream`. First I'll fetch upstream:

```
$ git fetch upstream

remote: Counting objects: 100% (27/27), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 16 (delta 12), reused 8 (delta 6), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (16/16), done.
From https://github.com/yt-project/yt
   2fa8519dd..29005b829  master     -> upstream/master
```

We can see the commit references between master and upstream/master as `2fa8519dd..29005b829`. We can look at all the commits between master and upstream/master with the log:

```
$ git log --oneline master..upstream/master

We can expand this a bit to see where HEAD is pointed.

```

You can see the commit IDs in this log between master and upstream/master reflect those that were returned with the fetch command. We can also see that my fork, origin/master is at the same point as my local copy of master. Let's merge upstream/master into master and see how the log changes.

```
$ git merge upstream/master

now we can see that my local copy of master is pointed to the same place as upstream/master. We can update my fork with git push:

```
$ git push origin master

Now our local copy, our fork, and our project's repository all have master
pointed to the same commit.  

aside: this is why branching is powerful. If we're working in a branch that's
constantly being updated with remote changes, we'll have to fetch and merge and
potentially perform a lot of conflict resolutions. We don't have to do that if
we're working in a thematic branch.

A fork is a copy of a repository associated with your user account (or another
organization). Earlier in the lesson we were pushing changes up to our
individual github accounts. However, you don't always have git commit rights to
different repositories. We don't want random people going and changing our
research code or our research papers! Forks help us by allowing people to copy
our code and make changes separately, and we can integrate those changes in our
own time.

Earlier we talked about `git fetch` and `get merge`. These two commands together
are `git pull`. A pull request is a request from an user for the collaborator
or organization to pull (or fetch and merge) their changes into their own
repository. This is the way that we incorporate our work into another repository
without commit rights. Pull requests can also be submitted on a single
repository between two branches.  

Github also has features that allow us to easily compare changes. We can do this on the command line the same way we diff two branches:

Or we can use the github GUI.

tips:
* always pull down fresh changes from master before you branch.
* branching is powerful because you
